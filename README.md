# Pure Discord Bot

> **The Discord bot as it should be: simple, powerful, and completely free.**

## ⚠️ Project Status: On Hold

**This project is currently paused for development prioritization.** While the concept and documentation represent a solid foundation for a comprehensive Discord bot solution, active development has been temporarily suspended to focus on other initiatives.

The codebase and documentation remain available for community contributions and future development.

Pure combines the best features from premium Discord bots like MEE6, Ticket Tool, DraftBot, and RaidProtect into a single, comprehensive solution—**without paywalls, premium tiers, or feature restrictions**.

## Why Pure?

**Discord bots shouldn't be locked behind paywalls.** Essential server management features should be accessible to everyone, regardless of budget.

### The Problem
- **MEE6**: Leveling and moderation features locked behind premium
- **Ticket Tool**: Advanced customization requires premium
- **DraftBot**: Economy and games need premium
- **RaidProtect**: Anti-raid features partially premium
- **Multiple bots**: Managing 5+ different bots with different commands and interfaces

### The Solution
Pure provides **all these features in one bot, completely free, forever.**

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 22.0.0 or higher
- **PostgreSQL/Supabase** database
- **Discord Bot Token** ([Create one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### Environment Setup

```env
# Required
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_bot_client_id
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/pure
```

## Production Deployment

Pure is designed for enterprise-grade deployments and can handle **100,000+ servers** with proper infrastructure.

### Scaling Considerations
- **Horizontal scaling** with multiple bot instances
- **Database clustering** for high availability
- **Redis caching** for improved performance
- **Load balancing** for API endpoints
- **Monitoring** with Prometheus and Grafana

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels! Pure is built by the community, for the community.

### Getting Started
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. **Open** a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines
- **Code Quality**: We use TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier
- **Testing**: Add tests for new features
- **Documentation**: Update docs for user-facing changes
- **Performance**: Consider impact on large servers (100k+ members)

## Philosophy

> "Essential Discord functionality should be accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford premium subscriptions."

Pure believes that:
- **Community first**: Features are driven by actual user needs, not profit margins
- **Transparency**: Open source means no hidden agendas or data harvesting
- **Quality**: Enterprise-grade code quality and reliability
- **Accessibility**: Free forever, with no artificial limitations
